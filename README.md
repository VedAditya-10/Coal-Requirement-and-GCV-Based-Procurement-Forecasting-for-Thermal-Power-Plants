This dataset created for this project contains plant-level monthly coal data for ***Indian thermal power plants***, compiled and standardised from 22 official monthly reports spanning January 2024 to October 2025.

The raw data was sourced from the National Power Portal (NPP), the Government of India’s official platform for power sector statistics. From here, you get datasets for daily, weekly and yearly consumption :

While the original reports are publicly available, they are released as complex, semi-structured Excel files with multi-row headers, regional groupings, embedded totals, and summary tables, making direct analysis difficult.

This dataset transforms those raw files into a single, clean, analysis-ready time-series dataset at the individual power plant level.
